# Statistical-Modeling-and-Pattern-Recognition

These are the projects that were assigned to the students taking the course.
They consist of exercises that are both theoretical and require programming.

In the projects are the files with the code for the exercises that were in matlab. Also the details for what each exercise needed as well as an overall report for the whole project is included.

The course as well as the exercises were given in greek but in the code there are comments in english.
